# OVERVIEW
PhiLib contains a number of libraries and projects I did during my Core Curriculum
at 42 Wolfsburg for the C language.

# CONTENT
::philib
	::libft
	::gnl
	::printf

# COMPILE
make philib 	=> compiles all projects into a philib.a library.
make philibd	=> compiles all projects into a philib.so dynamic library.

In order to individually compile/test projects read the readme in the
respective folder.
